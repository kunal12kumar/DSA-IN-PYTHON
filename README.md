# DSA Code Practices in Python

This repository contains various Python solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. The purpose of this repository is to help you learn and practice different DSA concepts and techniques in Python.

## Features

- **Data Structures**: Implementation of basic data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Solutions for common algorithms like sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph traversal, and more.
- **Problem Solving**: A collection of problems from platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, and others.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: All code is written in Python.
- **No external libraries**: The code is kept simple and does not use third-party libraries (except for some optional packages for testing).
